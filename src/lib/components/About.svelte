<p class="text-neutral-200 leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:text-lg">
    My curiosity about technology began at a young age, leading me to a deep fascination with the low-level details of how computers work. 
    I’m constantly amazed by the boundless variety that can emerge from simple sets of rules, which is why I created my AI evolution simulator. 
    I'm drawn to Machine Learning as a powerful tool to build a better future by automating monotonous tasks, reducing human bias, and solving problems that were previously out of reach. 
    I view engineering as the craft of creating simple, elegant, and maintainable solutions. 
    This portfolio itself is an example of that philosophy. 
    I built it from scratch with SvelteKit and documented it in its own <a href="design-system" class="font-semibold text-neutral-100 hover:text-main-200">design system</a>.

    When I'm not coding, I believe in maintaining a sharp mind and body through dedicated training in martial arts, calisthenics, and running. I also love diving into challenges, whether it's exploring the philosophical themes in a classic sci-fi novel or navigating the intricate world design of the Souls video game series.
