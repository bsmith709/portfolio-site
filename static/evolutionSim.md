# **AI Evolution Simulator**

### **Project Overview**

I developed this project as my final for CS4350: Fundamentals of Game Engine Design. It is an agent-based 3D evolution simulator built in C++ within my professor's custom game engine, AftrBurner. Inspired by a fascination with emergent behavior, I created a simulation where autonomous "actors" evolve based on environmental pressures. The core of the project was observing how complex survival and social strategies arise from a simple set of genetic rules, environmental constraints, and interactions with AI predators.  
The simulation runs on a fixed timestep and is highly customizable through an ImGui-based interface, which allows for real-time adjustments to over 40 parameters and visualization of evolutionary trends through data plots.

### **Phase 1: Core Systems and Survival Loop**

In the initial phase, I focused on building the foundational systems of the simulation.

##### World Generation and Actor Spawning  
I began by implementing the core environmental components. To create a natural-looking and evenly spaced distribution of resources, I wrote a deterministic spawning system that places Plants (the primary food source) in a phyllotaxis cluster pattern. I then spawned Actors around this cluster, initializing them with randomized physical traits (Speed, Size, Sense) and a starting energy level.

##### Survival Mechanics  
I then established the fundamental survival loop. Actors deplete energy over time at a rate determined by their physical traitsâ€”larger, faster, and more perceptive actors have higher energy costs. To survive, they must find and consume Apples that spawn on plants. If an actor's energy drops to zero, I remove it from the simulation. This core mechanic created the initial selective pressure: an actor had to be efficient enough to find food before it starved.

### **Phase 2: Reproduction, Evolution, and Environmental Threats**

This phase introduced the mechanics necessary for evolution to occur.

##### Genetic Inheritance  
I implemented the reproduction system, centered around Shelters. When two actors with sufficient energy meet in a shelter, they produce an offspring. I designed a system where the child inherits a mix of its parents' traits:

* **Physical Traits (Speed, Size, Sense):** Inherited by averaging the parents' values, plus a small, random mutation.  
* **Personality Traits (Social, Brave, Generous):** Inherited via a Mendelian model, where I gave each parent dominant or recessive alleles for each gene. This system was also subject to a configurable mutation rate that could flip an allele.

##### Predator AI  
To create a more dynamic and challenging environment, I introduced Predators. I programmed these AI agents to patrol the environment using a simple state machine (PATROLLING, CHASING, GRABBING). They detect actors within a forward-facing cone and will chase the closest one. This added a significant survival pressure, making traits like speed and predator awareness (Sense) critical.

### **Phase 3: Emergent Social Behaviors and System Refinement**

The final phase focused on implementing the personality-driven behaviors that would lead to complex social dynamics.

##### Behavioral Genetics  
I linked the inherited personality traits directly to the actors' decision-making logic within their state machine:

* **Social vs. Solitary:** I made social actors exhibit flocking behavior by moving towards the center of mass of nearby actors, while solitary actors actively move away from others.  
* **Brave vs. Cautious:** This gene determines an actor's flight distance from predators. Crucially, I programmed brave actors to attempt to rescue a captured teammate by charging the predator, which sometimes stuns it but also risks their own capture.  
* **Generous vs. Selfish:** I designed generous actors with surplus energy and food to actively seek out and share resources with hungry actors nearby, a behavior that selfish actors never exhibit.

##### GUI for Control and Observation  
To make the simulation a useful tool for observation, I developed a comprehensive GUI using ImGui and ImPlot. This interface allows for real-time control over 40+ simulation parameters, from simulation speed to mutation rates to predator speed. It also includes a suite of plots that track the population's average physical and genetic traits over time, providing clear, quantitative data on the evolutionary trends emerging from the simulation's rules.
